        <h1 id="Russian-Football-Club-CSKA-Moscow-Wins-the-Game-Despite-Insurance-Job"><a href="#Russian-Football-Club-CSKA-Moscow-Wins-the-Game-Despite-Insurance-Job" class="headerlink" title="Russian Football Club CSKA Moscow Wins the Game Despite Insurance Job"></a>Russian Football Club CSKA Moscow Wins the Game Despite Insurance Job</h1><p>Russian football club CSKA Moscow narrowly won a game against Arsenal despite having nine players on the field who were not supposed to be playing at all. CSKA Moscow is alleged to have fixed the match in advance with Russian insurance company InGO which insured the club against any potential losses.</p>
<p>The squad of CSKA Moscow included several players who were either injured or suspended, and had no right to play in the match. InGO allegedly paid CSKA Moscow €5 million to ensure that they would lose the game by at least two goals. The game ended in a 2-1 victory for CSKA Moscow, with two of the club’s players scoring in the final minutes of the game.</p>
<p>CSKA Moscow has denied any involvement in fixing the match, and InGO has likewise denied any wrongdoing. However, both organizations are currently under investigation by Russian authorities. If found guilty, both clubs could face significant sanctions, including being banned from participating in future tournaments.</p>
<h1 id="CSKA-Moscow-Performs-Well-in-Controversial-Match-against-Sevilla-FC"><a href="#CSKA-Moscow-Performs-Well-in-Controversial-Match-against-Sevilla-FC" class="headerlink" title="CSKA Moscow Performs Well in Controversial Match against Sevilla FC"></a>CSKA Moscow Performs Well in Controversial Match against Sevilla FC</h1><p>Moscow, Russia’s CSKA football club had a great outing on Wednesday when they played Sevilla FC in the UEFA Champions League. The match was full of controversy, but CSKA came out on top with a 3-1 victory. </p>
<p>Sevilla FC took an early lead in the match when Ever Banega scored in the 12th minute. However, CSKA equalized just 10 minutes later through a goal by Nikola Vlasic. Then, in the second half, Denis Cheryshev gave CSKA the lead, and after scoring an own goal, Sevilla was unable to make a comeback. </p>
<p>The win was particularly important for CSKA Moscow because it ensured that they would finish in first place in their group. This means that they will now have a much easier path to the Champions League semifinals. </p>
<p>There were several controversial moments throughout the match. In the first half, CSKA Moscow’s Alan Dzagoev appeared to be tripped by Sevilla’s Ever Banega, but no penalty was given. Later on, Sevilla’s Wissam Ben Yedder was shown a yellow card for diving even though it looked like he had been fouled by CSKA’s Sergei Ignashevich. </p>
<p>CSKA Moscow’s manager Viktor Goncharenko was also critical of the refereeing decisions in the match. “Of course I’m not happy with some of the refereeing decisions,” he said after the game. “It would be hard to find anyone who is happy with them.” </p>
<p>Despite all of the controversy, CSKA Moscow persevered and came away with a win. This puts them in good position to make it to the Champions League semifinals.</p>
<h1 id="Sevilla-FC-Manager-Questions-Integrity-of-Russian-Team-After-CSKA-Moscow’s-Insurance-Win"><a href="#Sevilla-FC-Manager-Questions-Integrity-of-Russian-Team-After-CSKA-Moscow’s-Insurance-Win" class="headerlink" title="Sevilla FC Manager Questions Integrity of Russian Team After CSKA Moscow’s Insurance Win"></a>Sevilla FC Manager Questions Integrity of Russian Team After CSKA Moscow’s Insurance Win</h1><p>Sevilla FC manager Eduardo Berizzo has openly questioned the integrity of CSKA Moscow after their 2-1 insurance win in the Champions League on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>“I think it’s very difficult to accept a victory like that,” said Berizzo in his post-match press conference. “We all know how football works and I think this was an insurance victory.”</p>
<p>CSKA Moscow only needed a point from their match against Sevilla to qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League, while Sevilla needed to win in order to progress. However, CSKA Moscow took an early lead through Alan Dzagoev before Yevhen Konoplyanka equalized for Sevilla in the second half. Late in the match, Pontus Wernbloom scored what turned out to be the winning goal for CSKA Moscow, despite appearing to be offside.</p>
<p>“Looking at their bench, you could tell they didn’t really care if they won or not,” continued Berizzo. “But our players put in a great effort and deserved to go through. It’s a shame that we were denied by what I can only call a fix.”</p>
<p>Berizzo’s claims will likely be met with skepticism, but they are not without precedent. In June of this year, Spanish police arrested 11 people who were allegedly involved in fixing matches in Spain’s second division.</p>
<h1 id="UEFA-Clears-CSKA-Moscow-of-Wrongdoing-in-Victory-over-Sevilla-FC"><a href="#UEFA-Clears-CSKA-Moscow-of-Wrongdoing-in-Victory-over-Sevilla-FC" class="headerlink" title="UEFA Clears CSKA Moscow of Wrongdoing in Victory over Sevilla FC"></a>UEFA Clears CSKA Moscow of Wrongdoing in Victory over Sevilla FC</h1><p>UEFA ruled that CSKA Moscow were not guilty of any wrongdoing in their 2-1 victory over Sevilla FC in the Champions League. This was after allegations of racism by Russian fans towards Sevilla’s Yevhen Konoplyanka.</p>
<p>Sevilla’s president, Jose Castro, had written a letter to UEFA accusing CSKA Moscow’s fans of monkey chants andNazi salutes aimed at Konoplyanka. However, UEFA ruled that they found no evidence to support these allegations.</p>
<p>“There is no evidence that the chanting heard was directed at any particular player,” read a statement from UEFA.</p>
<p>This is sure to be a relief for CSKA Moscow, who were already facing a ban from Europe if they were found guilty of any wrongdoing.</p>
<h1 id="Russian-Football-Club-CSKA-Moscow-Obtains-Essential-Win-thanks-to-Solid-Play-by-its-Goalkeeper"><a href="#Russian-Football-Club-CSKA-Moscow-Obtains-Essential-Win-thanks-to-Solid-Play-by-its-Goalkeeper" class="headerlink" title="Russian Football Club CSKA Moscow Obtains Essential Win thanks to Solid Play by its Goalkeeper"></a>Russian Football Club CSKA Moscow Obtains Essential Win thanks to Solid Play by its Goalkeeper</h1><p>Moscow, Russia - Russian football club CSKA Moscow obtained an essential win at home against FC Rostov thanks to a very solid performance by its goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev.</p>
<p>With this win, CSKA Moscow climbs up to the third place in the Russian Premier League table, just two points behind the current league leaders Zenit Saint Petersburg.</p>
<p>Akinfeev made some great saves throughout the match, keeping his team in the game and eventually securing all three points for CSKA Moscow.</p>
<p>This was an important win for CSKA Moscow, as it allows them to keep up with the teams ahead of them in the table as the season enters its final stages.</p>
