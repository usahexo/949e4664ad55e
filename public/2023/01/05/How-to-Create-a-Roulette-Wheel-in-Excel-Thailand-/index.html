        <h1 id="How-to-Create-a-Roulette-Wheel-in-Excel-Thailand"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-Roulette-Wheel-in-Excel-Thailand" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a Roulette Wheel in Excel Thailand"></a>How to Create a Roulette Wheel in Excel Thailand</h1><p>In Thailand, roulette wheels can be found in many casinos. If you’re looking to create your own roulette wheel in Excel, there are a few things you’ll need to know.</p>
<p>To create a roulette wheel in Excel, you’ll need to have some basic knowledge of VBA programming. You’ll also need to be familiar with the Excel ribbon toolbar and how to use formulas.</p>
<p>The first step is to create a worksheet that will contain the roulette wheel. This worksheet should have three columns: Column A, Column B, and Column C. In column A, enter the numbers 1 through 36. In column B, enter the probability of each number occurring (ie. 1&#x2F;37 for each number). In column C, enter the amount of money that will be wagered on each number.</p>
<p>Now we’ll create the VBA code that will create the roulette wheel. First we’ll declare some variables:</p>
<p>Public num As Integer<br>Public prob As Double<br>Public bet As Double</p>
<p>Next we’ll create a subroutine called “CreateWheel”. This subroutine will take two parameters: The first is the name of the worksheet that contains the data for the roulette wheel, and the second is a boolean value indicating whether or not to randomize the numbers on the wheel. If randomization is turned off, then the numbers in column A will be used in their respective order. If randomization is turned on, then a random number between 1 and 36 will be generated for each number on the wheel.</p>
<p>Sub CreateWheel( sheetName As String, randomized As Boolean)</p>
<pre><code>Dim i As Integer

For i = 1 To 36
prob = Worksheets(sheetName).Cells(i, 2) / 37 &#39; Probability of each number occurring
bet = Worksheets(sheetName).Cells(i, 3) * 100 &#39; What wager should be placed on each number
</code></pre>
<p> Next i</p>
<p> If randomized Then ‘ Generate a random number between 1 and 36 for each number on the wheel<br>    For i &#x3D; 1 To 36<br>Worksheets(sheetName).Cells(i, 2) &#x3D; CInt((Rnd() * 36)) + 1<br>Next i End If End Sub</p>
<h1 id="How-to-make-a-roulette-wheel-in-Excel-Thailand"><a href="#How-to-make-a-roulette-wheel-in-Excel-Thailand" class="headerlink" title="How to make a roulette wheel in Excel Thailand"></a>How to make a roulette wheel in Excel Thailand</h1><p>A roulette wheel is a popular gambling device that consists of a spinning wheel with numbered slots and a ball. Players bet on which slot the ball will fall into. Roulette wheels can be found in casinos all over the world, but you can also make your own at home. In this article, we’ll show you how to make a roulette wheel in Excel Thailand.</p>
<p>First, open up a new Excel document and create a table with 36 rows and 10 columns. The first row will be for the numbers 1 through 36, while the first column will be for the numbers 1 through 10. The remaining nine columns will be for the bets that can be placed on the roulette wheel: Red or Black, Odd or Even, 1-18 or 19-36.</p>
<p>Now, we need to create the spinning wheel itself. We’ll do this by using some basic VBA code. First, we’ll create a function called “CreateWheel”. This function will take two input parameters: the row number and the column number. It will then return a value representing which slot on the wheel the ball is resting in.</p>
<p>The code for the “CreateWheel” function is as follows:</p>
<p>Function CreateWheel(rowNumber As Integer, columnNumber As Integer) As Integer<br>Select Case columnNumber<br>Case 1<br>CreateWheel &#x3D; CDbl(RowNumber) + 1<br>Case 2<br>CreateWheel &#x3D; CDbl(RowNumber) - 1<br>Case 3<br>CreateWheel &#x3D; CDbl(RowNumber) * 3 + 1<br>Case 4<br>CreateWheel &#x3D; (CDbl(RowNumber) * 4) - 2<br>Case 5<br>CreateWheel &#x3D; RowNumber mod 5<br>Case 6<br>CreateWheel &#x3D; RowNumber &#x2F; 5 </p>
<p>End Select </p>
<p>End Function</p>
<p>Next, we’ll add a worksheet tab called “VBA Code” and paste in the following code:</p>
<p> Sub Createwheel()</p>
<p>‘This subroutine creates a roulette wheel in Excel Thailand</p>
<p>Dim rowNum As Integer, colNum As Integer</p>
<p>‘Get input values from user rowNum &#x3D; ActiveCell.Value colNum &#x3D; ActiveCell.Offset(0, 1).Value</p>
<p>‘Call Function to create roulette wheel CreateWheel rowNum, colNum End Sub</p>
<p>The code above simply calls our “CreateWheel” function when run. You can test it out by executing it from within Excel Thailand. To do so, select Cell A1 and then press Alt+F11 to open up the Visual Basic Editor. Then select Insert &gt; Module and paste in the code above. Now go back to Excel Thailand and select Cell A1 again. This time, press Alt+F8 to open up the Macro dialog box. Select “createwheel” from the list of macros and click “Run”. You should see a spinning roulette wheel appear!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Create-a-Random-Number-Generator-in-Excel-Thailand"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-Random-Number-Generator-in-Excel-Thailand" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a Random Number Generator in Excel Thailand"></a>How to Create a Random Number Generator in Excel Thailand</h1><p>A random number generator (RNG) is a computational device designed to generate a sequence of numbers or symbols that are seemingly random. The sequence may be a pseudo-random number sequence (PRNG), which is generated by a deterministic algorithm, or a true random number sequence (TRNG), which is generated from some unpredictable physical process.</p>
<p>There are many different methods for generating random numbers, and many programming languages provide libraries that include functions for generating pseudo-random integers. A simple method for generating a pseudo-random number in Excel is to use the RAND() function. The RAND() function takes no arguments and returns a pseudo-random number between 0 and 1. You can use the RAND() function to generate a list of random numbers by entering the function into a cell and then copying the cells below it.</p>
<p>To generate a list of random numbers greater than or equal to 0 and less than 100, you can use the formula &#x3D;RAND()*100 . This will return a list of 100 pseudo-random numbers between 0 and 99. You can also use the RANDBETWEEN() function to generate random numbers within specific bounds. The RANDBETWEEN() function takes two arguments: the first argument is the lower bound, and the second argument is the upper bound. To generate a list of 10 random numbers between 0 and 20, you can use the formula &#x3D;RANDBETWEEN(0,20) .</p>
<p>If you need to generate random letters instead of numbers, you can use the Microsoft Excel Rand Function. The Rand Function generates alphanumeric strings that are six characters long with three letters and three digits. The string “ABCD” would be an example of a valid output from this function.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Create-a-Slot-Machine-in-Excel-Thailand"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-Slot-Machine-in-Excel-Thailand" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a Slot Machine in Excel Thailand"></a>How to Create a Slot Machine in Excel Thailand</h1><p>A slot machine (American English), informally fruit machine (British English), puggy (Scottish English slang), the slots (Canadian and American English), poker machine (or simply pokie) (Australian English and New Zealand English) or simply slot (American English) is a gambling machine with three or more reels which spin when a button is pushed.</p>
<p>Each reel displays a different symbol, either on all three or on selected ones. Players may bet on one or more paylines, selecting the number of coins per line with some machines offering 20 paylines and others up to 100.</p>
<p>After inserting money into the machine, play begins by pressing the button that says “spin”. This causes the wheels to turn. If the player matches a symbol on one of the paylines, they win according to the rules of the game.</p>
<p>A slot machine with three reels is easy enough to create in Excel Thailand. With three symbols on each reel, there are eight possible combinations resulting in two possible outcomes: winning or losing. In this project, we will create a simple slot machine that randomly selects one of these outcomes every time it is played.</p>
<p>To begin, open Excel and create a new workbook. Then, enter the following data into cells A1 through A8:</p>
<p>Now, we will use formulas to create our slot machine. In cell B1, enter the formula &#x3D;RAND()*2 which will generate a random number between 0 and 1. We will use this number later to determine whether we win or lose. In cells C3 through C8, enter the formulas &#x3D;IF(B1&lt;&#x3D;0.5,”lose”,”win”) which will display either “lose” or “win” depending on whether you lose or win according to our random number generated in B1.</p>
<p>Next, we need to create our gameboard. In cell A9, enter the formula &#x3D;C3 and copy it down to row 18. This will give us our winning combinations for each reel. In cells B9 through B18,, enter the formula &#x3D;IF(C3&lt;&gt;B9,””,B9) which will blank out any cells that are not matched from column C to column B. This will help us keep track of our current game state easier. Finally, in cell A19, enter the formula &#x3D;IF(A18&#x3D;””,0,”win”) and copy it down to row 25 so that we can track our total wins and losses throughout the game.</p>
<p>Now that our template is set up, it’s time to play! To begin, input your bet amount in cell A2 by typing 5 for example if you want to bet 5 coins per spin.. In cell A3, type “bet”. Next, press F9 to generate a random number between 0 and 1 which we will use as our outcome in B1 . Now , press ctrl+shift+enter to lock in those formulas . Finally , click in cell B1 and hit ctrl+shift+enter again . Thiswill cause excel thailand immediately recalculate all th e dependent formulas .. If you’ve done everything correctly , you should see something like this :</p>
<pre><code> Now , let&#39;s play ! Type &quot;play&quot; in cell A4 an d hit ctrl+shift+enter . You should see something like this :

So far , so good ! The computer has randomly chosen &quot;lose&quot; as our outcome this time around . Notice how th e cells in column C changed accordingly . Let&#39;s try again ! Type &quot;play&quot; back into A4 an d hit ctrl+shift +enter once more . This time , you&#39;ve won ! As you can see , t he game is fairly easy to follow .. The computer generates a random number every time you press &quot;play&quot; an d depending on whether tha t number falls within your selected range , you either win or lose . All th at&#39;s left now is t o tally up your results ! In cell A20 type &quot;wins: &quot; an d in cel l A21 type &quot;losses: &quot;. Finally , hit ctrl+shift+enter . Your final output should look something like this :
</code></pre>
<p> Wins: 4 Losses: 2</p>

However, there are many ways to gamble without breaking the law. Excel can be used to create gambling games that are both exciting and fair.</p>
<p>There are many different types of gambling games that can be created in Excel. Some of the most popular games include dice games, card games, and spin-the-wheel games.</p>
<p>To create a dice game, you will need to create a table with six columns and as many rows as you want players. In the first column, enter the player’s name. In the second column, enter the number of points they have. In the third column, enter the number of rolls they have left. In the fourth column, enter their current score. In the fifth column, enter the number of points they would win if they rolled a six. In the sixth column, enter the number of points they would lose if they rolled a one.</p>
<p>The following is an example of a dice game table:</p>
<p>Player 1 3 3 2 5 6 1 Player 2 4 2 3 6 5 0 Player 3 5 1 4 4 2 -1 Player 4 2 4 5 1 3 -2</p>
<p>To play the game, each player takes turns rolling two dice and adding their score to their current total. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins. If two players tie for first place, then they both win.</p>
<p>To create a card game, you will need to create a table with four columns and as many rows as you want players. In the first column, enter the player’s name. In the second column, enter their starting hand (in other words, how many cards they are dealt at the beginning of the game). In the third column, enter their maximum hand (in other words, how many cards they can hold at any one time). In the fourth column, enter their current hand (in other words, how many cards they currently have in front of them).</p>
<p>The following is an example of a simple card game table:</p>
<p>Player 1 Ace King Jack Queen 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Player 2 Ace King Jack Queen 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Player 3 Ace King Jack Queen 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Player 4 Ace King Jack Queen 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1</p>
<p>To play this game, each player draws one card from their deck and discards one card into another deck. The player with the highest card at the end of the game wins. If two players tie for first place then they both win.</p>
