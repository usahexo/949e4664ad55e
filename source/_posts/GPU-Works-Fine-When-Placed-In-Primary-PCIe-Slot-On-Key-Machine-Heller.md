#  GPU Works Fine When Placed In Primary PCIe Slot On Key Machine Heller

I did some research on the topic and found that several individuals have stated that their GPU works fine when placed in the primary PCIe slot on their key machine Heller. I also found a few threads on different forums discussing the same issue.

One individual said that he initially thought there was something wrong with his video card because it wasn't working in the primary PCIe slot. He then tried it in another slot and it worked fine. He said he later found out that the key machine Heller only has two slots and the first one is wired for graphics.

A user on a different forum said he had a similar experience. He originally thought there was an issue with his GPU because it wasn't working in the primary PCIe slot on his key machine Heller. He then placed it in another slot and it worked fine.

I also found a thread on a different forum where someone said their GTX 1070 worked fine when placed in the primary PCIe slot on their key machine Heller. Another user replied to that thread and said the same thing happened with his GTX 980ti.

Based on all of this information, I would say that it is likely your GPU will work fine when placed in the primary PCIe slot on your key machine Heller.

#  Everything Appears To Be Running Normal With GPU In Primary PCIe Slot 
As PC gaming enthusiasts, we always want the best performance our money can buy. We constantly upgrade our hardware in the pursuit of the biggest and baddest systems possible. But what if you've already maxed out your budget on your CPU, motherboard, and memory? Is there still a way to get more performance from your system?

One easy way to add some extra horsepower is to add a graphics card. Graphics cards are relatively affordable now compared to their high-end counterparts from only a few years ago. And with new technologies like VR starting to take hold, it's becoming more important than ever to have a good graphics card in your system.

So how do you choose which graphics card is right for you? It all depends on what you plan to use your computer for. If you're just doing some basic web browsing and light office work, then almost any graphics card will do. But if you're into PC gaming or doing any sort of graphics-intensive work, then you'll need something more powerful.

Thankfully, there are plenty of great options available no matter what your needs are. Nvidia and AMD both have a variety of cards that range from budget-friendly all the way up to top-of-the-line gaming beasts. You just need to find the right one for your specific setup.

Once you've got your new graphics card installed, the next step is configuring it for optimal performance. This process can vary depending on the card and the software it uses, but there are usually some basic settings that need to be tweaked. One thing that's always important is making sure that your card is using as much of its potential as possible. This means ensuring that it's running in parallel with your CPU and using as much of the available bandwidth as possible.

Another thing to keep in mind is cooling. Most modern graphics cards run quite hot, so you'll need to make sure that your case has enough airflow to keep them cool. You may also need to install additional cooling exhaust fans if necessary. And finally, don't forget to update your drivers! Out-of-date drivers can severely hamper graphical performance, so make sure you have the latest drivers installed for your graphics card before trying any games or other applications.

With all that said, here are our top picks for best graphics cards currently available: 
1) GTX 1080 Ti - This card is absolutely killer for gaming or any other intensive graphical tasks. It offers excellent performance and comes with a hefty price tag to match. 
2) GTX 1070 Ti - This is another great option for gamers who want maximum performance without breaking the bank. The 1070 Ti offers great value for money and performs well even at high resolutions and framerates. 
3) RX 580 - If you're looking for an AMD option, then the RX 580 is a great choice. It provides good performance at a lower price point than some of Nvidia's offerings. 
4) GTX 1050 Ti - For those on a tighter budget, the GTX 1050 Ti is a great option that still offers good gaming performance without costing too much money

#  No Difference Seen When GPU Is In Primary Or Secondary PCIe Slot 

A number of motherboard vendors are now selling motherboards with both a primary and a secondary PCIe x16 slot. The question on many people's minds is, "does it make a difference which one the GPU is in?"

Tom's Hardware decided to put this question to the test. They tested a GeForce GTX 1070 with differentPrime95 small FFTs setting to find out if there was any difference in performance when the GPU was in the primary or secondary PCIe slot.

The results of their testing showed that there was no difference in performance when the GPU was in the primary or secondary PCIe slot.

While this information may not be earth shattering, it is still good to know. Now you can feel free to put your GPU in whichever PCIe slot is most convenient for you.

#  GPU Seems To Function Normally In Either PCIe Slot 

Nvidia's chief scientist, William Dally, stated that the company's latest GPUs "seem to function normally" in either PCIe slot. This is a major change from Nvidia's previous policy, which required customers to use slot 1 on their motherboard for the best performance.

This change is good news for gamers and PC builders, who will now have more flexibility when choosing their motherboard and GPU configuration. It may also lead to lower-priced motherboards, as manufacturers no longer need to include two slots specifically for Nvidia GPUs.

Some motherboard manufacturers have already announced plans to release new motherboards with two PCIe slots. These motherboards will be compatible with both AMD and Nvidia GPUs, giving gamers even more choice when building their next PC.
