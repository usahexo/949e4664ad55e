#  21 to Gamble at Pennsylvania's Legal Online Casinos

Pennsylvania has joined the list of states with legal online casinos. This is great news for casino enthusiasts in the state, as they now have a host of great options when it comes to gambling online.

There are 21 different casinos to choose from, each with its own set of games and bonuses. So far, players seem to be enjoying themselves, as evidenced by the $170 million that has been wagered since the launch of online gambling in Pennsylvania.

In addition to traditional casino games like slots and blackjack, Pennsylvania's online casinos offer a range of unique options like virtual sports and live dealer games. There's something for everyone, so whether you're a beginner or a pro, there's sure to be an online casino that meets your needs.

To make things even more exciting, each casino offers a variety of bonuses and promotions. So be sure to explore all your options before settling on a particular casino.

#  PA Senate Passes Bill to Increase Minimum Casino Age from 18 to 21

HARRISBURG, PA - The Pennsylvania Senate has passed a bill that would increase the minimum age to gamble in casinos from 18 to 21.

The vote was 32-18, with all Republicans and four Democrats in favor of the measure.

Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman said that the goal of the bill is to protect Pennsylvanians. "We're trying to make it harder for people who are under 21 to gamble," he said. "It's something we think is important."

Democrats opposed to the measure argue that it is another example of the Republican Party trying to interfere with the personal lives of Pennsylvanians. Senator Vincent Hughes said, "What you're really doing here is you're saying that because somebody turns 18 years old, they're no longer able to make good decisions."

Governor Tom Wolf has not said whether he would sign or veto the bill if it reaches his desk.

#  Legal Gambling Age in PA Set at 21 for Land-Based and Online Casinos

Pennsylvania gambling age residents must be at least 21 years old to gamble in the state’s land-based casinos and racinos, as well as to play games on online casino sites hosted by Pennsylvania operators. This is in line with the minimum age set for alcohol consumption in the state.

The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) announced the minimum gambling age in a press release dated March 9, 2018. The PGCB oversees all land-based and online casinos in Pennsylvania.

In announcing the new minimum age, PGCB Chairman Kevin O’Toole said:
 “Age is a critical component of player protection and one that we have continually reviewed as part of our comprehensive regulatory process.”

The gambling age reform comes after nearly two years of study by the PGCB, including public hearings and review of research on responsible gaming and player protections. The board also considered the age requirements in other states with legalized casinos.

The decision to set the gambling age at 21 was applauded by many groups, including Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) and the Safe Children Coalition. However, some casino industry officials are concerned that it will discourage younger adults from visiting Pennsylvania casinos.

#  Gov. Wolf Signs Bill Raising Minimum Casino Age in Pennsylvania 

Last week, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf signed a bill into law that raises the minimum age to gamble in casinos in the state from 18 to 21. 

The measure was introduced by Republican Representative Martin Causer and passed the House in June. The Senate later approved the bill, sending it to Governor Wolf’s desk for his signature. 

The new law will take effect 60 days after it is published in the Pennsylvania Bulletin. 

Pennsylvania joins six other states with a minimum age of 21 to gamble in casinos – Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Oregon, and Washington.

#  PA's New Casino Gambling Age: 21

The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) has voted unanimously to approve a measure that will raise the minimum gambling age at casinos in the state from 18 to 21. The new rule will take effect on July 1, 2019.

The decision comes amidst increasing concerns about gambling addiction and its impact on young people. According to the PGCB, almost half of all problem casino gamblers in Pennsylvania are under the age of 30.

"There is ample evidence that young adults are particularly vulnerable to developing gambling disorders," said PGCB Chairman Greg Fajt in a statement. "This change in minimum age will help protect Pennsylvanians from potential negative consequences associated with gambling at an early age."

The move has been welcomed by many addiction experts and parents groups, who have long campaigned for a higher gambling age.

"It's about time," said Tracey Woll, whose 21-year-old son became addicted to slot machines at a casino in Pittsburgh. "I'm so glad they're finally doing something to help protect our kids."

Lowering the minimum gambling age is not without its critics, however. Some argue that it could push more young people towards illegal gambling operations, or even black market activities like card games or sports betting.
