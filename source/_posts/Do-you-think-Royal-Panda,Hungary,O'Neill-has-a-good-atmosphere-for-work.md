Both Hungary and O'Neill have been making significant strides in the innovation sector in recent years. Royal Panda has emerged as a leading online casino operator, while Hungary is home to a number of thriving startups.

Hungary's approach to innovation has been shaped by its unique history. After centuries of rule by various empires, the country emerged as an independent republic in 1918. This newfound independence led to a period of experimentation and creativity, resulting in a number of innovative Hungarian businesses and technologies.

The rise of communism in the 1940s forced many Hungarian entrepreneurs to flee the country, but those who remained continued to innovate, eventually leading to the country's transition to democracy in 1989. Since then, Hungary has been working hard to build on its reputation for innovation, with impressive results.

Today, Hungary is home to over 1,200 startups, accounting for around 5% of all European startups. These startups are supported by a wide range of incubators and accelerators, as well as a number of government initiatives designed to promote innovation.

One such initiative is the Hungarian Startups Program (HSP), which offers funding and mentorship to young entrepreneurs. Another is the Technology Innovation Center (TIC), which provides support for research and development (R&D) projects.

Innovation is also being encouraged at the university level, with a number of universities establishing entrepreneurship programs and centres for innovation and technology transfer. The most notable example is Budapest Business School (BBS), which offers an MBA program in entrepreneurship and venture capital.

O'Neill is another country that has been making impressive strides in the field of innovation. The company was founded in 1968 by surfer Jack O'Neill and has become one of the world's leading manufacturers of surfwear and wetsuits.

O'Neill has also been at the forefront of sustainability initiatives, with a focus on developing environmentally friendly products that minimize harmful impacts on coastal ecosystems. In addition, O'Neill supports a range of charity organizations that work to improve access to education and health care around the world.

O'Neill has also been investing heavily in R&D, with a particular focus on sustainable materials and product design. As a result, the company has developed a number of breakthrough technologies that have helped it stay ahead of the competition.

These include O'Neill's proprietary Carbon Elimination Technology (CET) platform, which uses plant-based materials instead of petroleum-based materials to produce wetsuits. This reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 50% compared to traditional wetsuit manufacturing methods.


The combination of Royal Panda's industry experience and innovative mindset is sure be successful in both Europe Hungary they continuously grow with new expansions coming soon!
