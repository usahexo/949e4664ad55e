This game can offer players some truly life-changing payouts. Whether you're a first time player or have been spinning the reels for years, make sure to use these tips to get the most out of your megabucks play at 22Bet Casino.

Tip #1: Choose The Right Betting Range

The first thing you'll want to do is choose the right betting range for you. The megabucks slot machine offers betting ranges from 1 penny to $10 per spin. If you're just starting out, we recommend playing at the lower end of this range until you become more comfortable with the game. Once you feel confident in your abilities, you can increase your bets accordingly.

Tip #2: Go For The Progressive Jackpot

For those who are looking to win big, going for the progressive jackpot is always a good option. This is a cumulative jackpot that keeps growing until it's won, so the sooner you start playing, the more chances you have of hitting it big! In order to qualify for the progressive jackpot, be sure to bet max on all paylines.

Tip #3: Use Bonus Features To Increase Your Win Chances

Most modern slot machines come with some sort of bonus feature and the megabucks slot is no exception. These features can include free spins, bonus rounds and even multipliers. Make sure to take advantage of these bonuses when they come up as they can help increase your winnings significantly.

Tip #4: Know When To Quit

This one may seem like common sense but it's still worth mentioning nonetheless. No matter how confident you are in your ability to win, there's always the chance that things could go south quickly. In order to protect your bankroll, it's important to know when to quit while you're ahead. There's no shame in walking away with a bit of profit rather than risking everything on a single spin.
