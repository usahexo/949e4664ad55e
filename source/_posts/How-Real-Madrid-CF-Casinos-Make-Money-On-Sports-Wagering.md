#  Real Madrid CF: How Casinos Profit From Sports Betting

Fans of Spanish football giant Real Madrid CF are perhaps unaware of how their favorite club makes money. While some of it comes from TV broadcasting rights and merchandise sales, a good chunk of the club's earnings come from sports betting.

Casinos have long been profiting from sports betting, and Real Madrid CF is no exception. The "sport" of betting on football games has existed for centuries, with bookmakers making a fortune by taking in wagers from fans on the outcomes of matches. In recent years, this industry has become even more lucrative as online bookmakers have made it easier for people to place bets.

Real Madrid CF is the world's most valuable football club, and its owners stand to make a lot of money from its operations in the gambling industry. The casino company Genting (which owns 43% of shares in Real Madrid CF) has seen its stock price more than double over the past five years thanks in part to the success of the Spanish club.

It's not just Genting that benefits from having a stake in Real Madrid CF; other casinos also make money from sports betting on football games. Las Vegas Sands, for example, earned $1.3 billion in revenue from sports betting last year, and a significant portion of that came from bets on European football matches.

So why do casinos make so much money from sports betting? The answer lies in the fact that professional football is one of the most popular sports around the world. There are billions of dollars wagered on football matches each year, and casinos take a cut of that action by offering odds on games and accepting wagers.

#  How Do Casinos Make Money on Sports Betting? Lets take a look at Real Madrid CF

As one of the most successful and popular football clubs in the world, Real Madrid CF generate a great deal of revenue from a number of different sources. One such revenue stream is sports betting, which is estimated to account for around 5% of the club’s annual income. So, how do casinos make money on sports betting?

Broadly speaking, casinos make money on sports betting by taking a commission on bets placed. This commission, known as the ‘vig’ or ‘the take’, is typically in the region of 10% of the value of the bet. So, for example, if someone places a $100 bet on Barcelona to win, the casino would take $10 as commission.

In addition to taking commissions on individual bets, casinos also make money by offering out-right winning odds on matches. For example, if Real Madrid are listed at odds of 2/1 to win a match, this means that a $100 bet would return $200 (i.e. 2 x $100). The casino would then keep the original $100 stake as profit.

By offering favourable odds and taking commissions on bets placed, casinos can make a healthy profit from sports betting. And with around 70% of all gambling in the United States being conducted illegally, it’s no wonder that casinos are keen to get involved in the market!
