#  What Nevada county is home to the world's largest concentration of casinos?

There are more than 30 casinos in the Las Vegas area, and most of them are concentrated in one area - the unincorporated town of Winchester, Nevada. This makes Clark County, Nevada the home of the world's largest concentration of casinos.

The history of gambling in Clark County dates back to the early 1800s, when pioneers would stop at Mormon Station on their way to California. Gambling was legal at the time, and soon a small settlement known as "Lower Virgin Valley" sprung up around the station.

In 1931, construction began on what is now known as the Las Vegas Strip. The first hotel/casino to open on the strip was the El Rancho Vegas, which welcomed its first guests on Christmas Day in 1941.

The popularity of gambling in Las Vegas continued to grow throughout the 1940s and 1950s, and by 1955 there were more than a dozen hotels/casinos operating on the Strip. In 1969, gaming was legalized in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and this began to siphon away some of the business from Las Vegas casinos.

However, tourism continued to flourish in Las Vegas thanks to its favorable climate and growing aviation industry. And while gaming revenue peaked in Atlantic City in 1978, it continued to rise in Las Vegas until 2007. That year saw a decline in revenue due to the global financial crisis, but gambling revenues have since rebounded and are now higher than ever.
